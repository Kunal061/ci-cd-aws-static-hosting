## How Screenshots Are Used

These screenshots are embedded in the main project README to:
- **Visual Documentation**: Provide step-by-step visual guidance for setup
- **Verification**: Help users confirm they're on the right screen during configuration
- **Troubleshooting**: Serve as reference points when diagnosing issues
- **Learning**: Illustrate the complete CI/CD pipeline architecture

## Screenshot Naming Convention

Screenshots follow the pattern: `screenshot-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.png`  
This timestamp-based naming ensures chronological ordering and prevents naming conflicts.

## Maintenance Notes

- Screenshots should be updated if UI changes significantly
- Each screenshot should be under 500KB for optimal loading
- PNG format is preferred for clarity and text readability
- All screenshots are referenced in the main README.md using relative paths
